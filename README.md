# Shipping-Project
This project is from Tryhackme under Phython Basics.
 In this project, you'll create a program that calculates the total cost of a customers shopping basket, including shipping.      
 - If a customer spends over $100, they get free shipping
 - - If a customer spends &lt; $100, the shipping cost is $1.20 per kg of the baskets weight
